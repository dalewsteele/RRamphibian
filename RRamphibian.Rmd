## What is Reproducible Research?

Recalculate the numbers and figures in a data analysis from the raw data using code
tools that ingerate code, plain text and figures "literate programming"

```{r}
devtools::session_info()$packages
```

## Version control

## Motivation
-- Occassional data analyst
-- Experience
-- Master's thesis

## Old Workflow
-- USB drive --> email --> Dropbox --> github

## Poll audience about their workflow

> - Statistical program --> cut and paste
> - Sweave --> pdf
## Rules
-- Everything is a text file
-- Tidy data
-- Raw data

## common Features
- Text is best!
- Markup language (LaTeX, HTML, markdown, rmarkdown)

## Two types of chunks

- .Rnw (R+LaTeX) --> knitr (Sweave) --> .pdf

<<>>=

@

```{r}

```



## R/RStudio/knitr/pandoc

## git/Github



## Slide with Bullets

- The raw data
- A tidy data set
- Codebook describing earch variable and its values in the tidy data set
- An explicit and exact recipe to go from 1 to 2
-The ideal instruction list is a script


## Slide with R Code and Output

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
